# *NumberPrime*
## Iteration 2

### Brief Overview
*NumberPrime* is a website built for elementary school-aged students to practice math at home. What sets
it apart from similar sites is that it allows a student's teacher to both track their student's progress
as well as suggest to students what they study. It was developed for a semester-long project in CS506 at the University of Wisconsin-Madison under the direction of Professor Ben Liblit.
